WSDL2Android

WSDL2Android is a project which takes a WSDL file (or files) and generates 
client side code to connect to the service behind the WSDL file from an Android
client.  The big goal of this project is to make that connection as easy as 
possible from the client class:
* No dependencies on the Android project.
* No explicit XML parsing needed in the Android project.
* WSDL Types and Services available as full Java classes.

Maven and Ant plugins will be available to trigger the code generation as part
of a standard build process.
